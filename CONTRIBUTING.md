## How to contribute to VexCTF

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in VexCTF**. Instead send us the details as is described in our [security policy](https://github.com/Vexillologists/VexCTF-spec/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Vexillologists/VexCTF-spec/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Vexillologists/VexCTF-spec/issues/new). Be sure to fill out the issue template with a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible (e.g. deployment setup, browser version, etc).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or implements a new feature?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Ensure all status checks pass. PR's with test failures will not be merged. PR's with insufficient coverage may be merged depending on the situation.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of VexCTF will sometimes not be accepted.
